How to Use Git and GitHub

Reflections - Navigating a Commit History

I would rather use filemerge then the Terminal because you can see the actual file contents side by side and see the difference very clearly.

-- How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the big that was introduced?

Being able to list the changes and then go through them made it easy to find the issue.  That being said I would rather use FileMerge because the output is much more clear.


-- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Being able to see when something was changed should help find any newly introduced bugs or issues which will save a lot of time.


-- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros
You have full control of when you to our commits so they have more of a meaning.  You can make sure that each commit has a purpose and leaves the code in a working condition.

Cons
There is always a chance of losing something because it wasn't committed.


-- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In Git, each Commit is supposed to have a purpose, that purpose could include changes that have to be made to multiple files.  That is how coding works.  


-- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Well git log you will show you a list of commits. Based on the message and the files changed you get some information including the Commit IDs.

Using git diff you see what changed between commits.


-- How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Since you can always go back to another commit making changes to the code is nothing to worry about.


-- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I really don't know.  I learned how to go back to a previous Commit which I think could be huge for me.  I have a lot more confidence within Git.
