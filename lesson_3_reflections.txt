How to Use Git and GitHub

Reflections - Lesson 3 - Creating an Modifying a Repository

-- What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

An empty Git Repo gets created by way of a .git folder being added to the directory.

It needs to be done because it creates the Repo, we need a Repo.


-- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers.

The staging area sits between the working directory and the repository.

It allows you to only commit the files you want to at any time.


-- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can make sure that you only add the files that you have changed that belong together in a single commit.  Then perform the commit.  You can also use the git diff --staged function to find out what was actually changed that is in the staging area.


-- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?  How would branches help?

Any time you are going to make a rather major change or try something new it would be a good idea to create a new branch for that.  That way you can always easily go back to your previous branch to go back to your original code.

Branches are a labeled commit.


-- How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure.

It makes it easy to see what commits are parents of other commits and any commits that may be unreachable.



-- What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it in the diagram as we do?

The code from each branch is merged into a single branch.  The two branches are merged into a single branch.



-- What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

The pros of automatic merging is that it is quick and easy and if there are no conflicts or issues automatic merging is easy.  
The cons is that there is no possible way for Git to know how to merge things if there is a conflict.
Merging manually means that you have control over exactly what is going on but it will take time to do it.
